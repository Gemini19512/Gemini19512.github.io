"Eavesdropping again, I see," Kakashi remarked with a sigh. "You might as well come in, Naruto. I know you're right outside the door." He watched as his former student entered the room with an amused smirk. Even at nineteen years old, sometimes Naruto still acted up on his childish behavior. Today seemed to be no exception.

"Heh, you caught on a little quicker than I thought," Naruto snickered, not bothered that he'd been caught.

The silver-haired Hokage remained stoic. "Can I help you with something? As you can see, I'm in the middle of a meeting," he pointed out, motioning to three members from the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force.

"Well, I couldn't help but overhear something about some secret endurance test that you guys were talking about," Naruto began. "I'm kind of curious about it and-"

"No." Kakashi flatly stated.

Naruto gaped at him, taken aback by his curt answer. "No? What do you mean by that? It sounds awesome, and-"

"First off," Kakashi interrupted him, "You don't know any details about it, so you shouldn't be so quick to want to try it. Second, it such an extreme test, that it is banned in most areas. It's supposed to last six hours, but no one has ever made it past the two-hour mark."

The blond ninja chuckled. "That's nothing. I guarantee that I'll be able to make it all the way to the end, no doubt about it."

Kakashi stared at him, mildly amused. "You seem rather confident. If you really insist on trying it, I'll allow you to. In fact, if you make it all the way to the end, I'll even give you a small prize for your efforts."

"Really? You'll let me try it? Alright!" Naruto cheered. "I thought it was gonna be a bit harder to convince you, to be honest. Maybe you're getting soft in your old age, huh?"

Kakashi's eye twitched slightly. "I'm not that old, Naruto. Anyway, if you're serious about this, report to the headquarters of the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force in two hours." He paused for a moment, as if thinking. "You and Hinata are together now, aren't you?"

"Yup," Naruto stated proudly.

"Bring her with you," Kakashi told him. "You'll need her to complete the test. Unless, of course, you'd prefer to bring someone else."

Naruto shook his head. "Nah, I'll bring Hinata. With her by my side, there's no way I can lose."

"Okay, then. You'd better prepare yourself," Kakashi remarked with an amused, mildly warning undertone.

Two hours later, Naruto and Hinata arrived at the headquarters and were escorted into one of the many rooms in the building. Although slightly nervous, Hinata had not hesitated to help him out. If he needed her, then she would do her best to make sure he completed the test.

"So, what exactly is this test about?" Hinata asked him once they were left alone in the room together. The room had a single table in it, with a small box resting on top of it. An 'X' had been scrawled on the floor with red paint. There was a timer mounted up on the wall, with '6:00:00' displayed on it to show that there would be a countdown of six hours.

Naruto tried to open the box, only to realize that it was locked. "Don't know yet. But there's an envelope on that table right there, so maybe that'll tell us." He tore the envelope open and read the contents of the folded piece of paper inside. "So...apparently I'm supposed to strip down to my boxers and then stand on that 'X'," he mused. "That's kind of weird...but whatever, I'll do it." Without another thought, he began to remove his clothes, causing Hinata's face to turn a light shade of red. Once he was down to his orange boxers, he walked over to the X and stood over it. "Now what?"

Tree roots suddenly shot up through the ground, immediately taking the startled ninja in their grasp.

"Hey, what the hell!?" Naruto was suspended a few feet off the floor, a root wrapped around each of his wrists and ankles, rendering him immobile. He struggled against their hold, unable to break free. His body was in an X formation, with his arms up and his legs spread apart. "Is this part of the test or something?"

Hinata stared at the display in shock. "W-well, you did say it was an endurance test. If that's the case, then it's not unusual for you to be restrained like that." She was still blushing, shamefully looking away from his muscular body.

"But now what?" Naruto asked, annoyed as he tugged at the stubborn roots. "These must have come from Yamato-sensei. Those are the only things that I can't escape from easily. Makes sense, I guess..." Still, he couldn't help but be a little embarrassed from his position. After all, he was practically naked in front of his girlfriend. Then again, if anyone was to see him like that, he'd prefer it be Hinata. Now he could see why Kakashi had suggested that he brought her along.

A puff of smoke appeared in the corner of the room, leaving behind a second envelope in its wake, as well as a key. Hinata went over to it and opened it up, reading the contents.

"What's it say?" Naruto asked.

"Naruto-kun...this endurance test that you're about to take..." Hinata's voice trailed off, and she brought the letter over to him and held it up so that he could read it.

'The test you are about to begin will determine just how strong your endurance and determination is. For the next six hours, you will be subjected to intense tickling, administered by your partner. The box on the table includes various tools, but is not limited to, that can be used to assist with the tickling. The key that was sent with this letter unlocks that box. The roots will keep you restrained until the six hours are up, or you pass out. No spot on the body is off-limits. The more you are tickled, the more chakra the roots detect, and the longer they will keep their hold. You are allowed a five minute break every hour. If the break lasts too long, the roots will eventually release you, but you will be forfeiting the test. If you make it to the end, you will receive a special award for your accomplishment. On that note, do your best and fight until your body no longer allows you to.'

"This is a tickle endurance test?" Naruto swallowed a lump in his throat. He didn't know just how ticklish he was, but he was afraid to find out.

Noticing his apprehension, Hinata spoke up. "If you don't want to do this, then-"

"No," Naruto said with a reluctant sigh. "I'll do it. I made a big deal about it earlier, and I don't back down from anything. I'll prove to Kakashi that I can deal with anything," he added with determined vigor. "So do your worst, Hinata." He sounded surprisingly challenging. "And no matter what I say, don't stop or let me quit. Promise me."

"If that is what you wish, Naruto-kun. I promise I won't let you give up." Hinata walked over to the box and unlocked it, displaying its contents.

Naruto's eyes widened a bit as he looked at the items it had been stocked with; a few stiff feathers, a toothbrush, a paintbrush, and a small, fluffy feather duster. Seconds later, the timer on the wall began its countdown, motioning for the test to finally begin.

Hinata hesitated, not sure which item she should use on him. However, not wanting to ponder on the thought too long, she left the items alone for the time being and walked over to the restrained blond. She gazed up at him apologetically before reaching up and lightly scribbling her nails along his bare sides.

Naruto snorted and tried to squirm away from the sensations. "Hehehehehehehe," he chuckled, unable to hold back his laughter. He could already tell that he was in big trouble. "Thahahahat tihihickles!"

"S-sorry," Hinata murmured, but kept at it. Like Naruto, she wouldn't go back on her word. She continued to tickle his sides, her lithe fingers moving up and down his sensitive skin. It became clear that due to the fact that Naruto was suspended off the ground, she would be unable to reach most of his upper body. Which meant that his lower body would feel the brunt of the torment.

"Hahahahahahahaha!" No matter how much he tried to resist, Naruto just couldn't block out the maddening sensations. Her fingers were so smooth and soft, which seemed to intensify the effect of the tickling. It was going to be a long six hours.

Hinata moved from his sides, over to where his naval was, right above his boxers. She tickled his stomach, which appeared to be even more ticklish than his sides.

"Nohohohohahahahahaha!" Naruto tried to thrash, only to be held tight by those damn roots. He looked over to where the timer was, dismayed to see that not even two minutes had passed. It had only just started, but he already felt as though he had been tickled for hours.

"Should I stop?" Hinata asked him, drawing circles around his belly-button and tracing the contours of his abs with her feathery touches.

Naruto desperately wanted the tickling to cease, but couldn't bring himself to give her the order to stop. No, he was determined to finish this stupid test, no matter what. He vigorously shook his head 'no', his eyes fused shut as he tried to suppress his laughs.

After a few more minutes of working on his stomach, Hinata paused for a moment to allow Naruto to take a breather, giving him just enough time to regain his composure.

"Oh, god..." Naruto panted heavily, his heart pounding in his chest. "Th-thanks for the break, I needed-" He gasped and looked down to see that Hinata was lightly stroking the bottom of his right foot with a single finger. It was then that he realized that his feet were much more ticklish than both his sides and naval put together. "Hinatahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!" He laughed uncontrollably as Hinata now tickled both of his helpless feet. "NOOO! Hahahahahahaha!"

"S-sorry, but I can't stop for too long..." Hinata's fingers skittered over his heels, up his arches, along his insteps, over the balls of his feet, and stopped right at the base of his toes. She went back and forth between every inch of his feet, amazed at just how ticklish he was. Intrigued by what was his weakest spot so far, Hinata kept up the torment for about five minutes, occasionally wiggling her fingers in between his toes.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! STOHAHAHAHAP! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! IT TIHIHIHIHIHICKLES T-T-TOO MUHAHAHAHUCH!" Naruto yelled desperately in between laughs.

Suddenly ashamed at her behavior, Hinata stopped. "I-I'm sorry, N-Naruto-kun," she apologized. "I don't know w-what came over me..."

Naruto regained his breath, surprised to find that he wasn't upset by what she had done. Then again, he doubted there was anything she could do that would actually upset him. "No, it's fine. Heh, at least I know that I won't lose this if I have you helping me, right? So keep it up."

"O-okay." With that, Hinata grabbed the feather duster from the box, as well as a single feather, vaguely aware of how Naruto's eyes widened upon seeing them. Before he could protest, she began to sweep at the sole of his left foot with the duster, dragging the soft feathers up and down. She used the other stiffer feather to tickle his right foot, using the quill to saw in between his wiggling toes.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAHAH! HINATAHAHA! NOHOHOHOHOT MY TOHOHOHOHOES!" He begged through his laughter. He curled and uncurled his toes, trying to wiggle them away from the feathers that relentlessly dusted under and between them.

The feather torture continued for several minutes, until Naruto felt something wet gliding under his toes. He looked down in shock to see that Hinata had discarded the feathers and was now using her tongue to tickle him. She licked and sucked on his toes, using her fingertips to lightly brush along the sole of his foot. Although it tickled Naruto like nothing else he'd ever felt, he felt it to be somewhat enjoyable, in a strange sort of way.

"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I CAHAHAHAN'T TAHAHAHAHAKE IHIHIHIHIT!" Naruto laughed, trying to squirm and buck. He threw his head back, feeling tears run down his face as Hinata mercilessly tickled his toes with the tip of her tongue. "HEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

While Hinata lapped away at Naruto's toes, she glanced up and was surprised to see that he had grown hard through his orange boxers. She blushed profusely, wondering if Naruto was aware of his erection. If he had gotten a hard-on during what was supposed to be torture, then did that mean that he was actually enjoying it? Hinata pondered this thought for another ten minutes, utilizing her time to lick every last inch of Naruto's trapped feet, before taking a break from sensitive soles. She'd go back to those later, but for now, she was curious about a different matter.

"Oh, god..." Naruto was breathing heavily, his muscular body glistening with sweat. Now THAT had been torture. He looked over at the timer, feeling his heart sink just a little. Only an hour had passed since the 'test' had begun. Still, that meant he could now have a brief five-minute break to compose himself.

"How are you holding up, Naruto-kun?" Hinata asked him sympathetically. She couldn't help but notice that he had gone limp again.

He chuckled nervously. "Oh, I'm fine. That was nothing."

"Are you sure you want to continue?" The indigo-haired girl questioned.

"I already told you that I'm not going to give up on this," he stated, already recovered from the relentless tickles. His high stamina was to thank for that, though he realized that it would probably keep him from passing out halfway through. He didn't know if that would be a good thing or a bad thing. However, before he realized it, his five minutes were up and Hinata was already working on a different spot on his body that he hadn't expected her to go after; his thighs.

Hinata's nails lightly raked up and down his muscular thighs, causing him to break out in hysterical laughter all over again. It seemed that his thighs were another weak spot of his. At that point, though, it seemed like whatever Hinata touched was a weak spot.

"Nohohohahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahaha!" Naruto tried to squirm away and break free from those damn roots, cursing them as they held him tight. He threw his head back and laughed even louder as Hinata moved towards his inner thighs. "Thahahahahat tickles t-too muhahahahahuch!" He wasn't aware that he had begun to grow hard all over again, but Hinata certainly noticed.

Even if Naruto didn't realize it, he must've been enjoying the torment to a certain degree, as it was apparent that he was getting turned on. Hinata couldn't help but watch in awe as Naruto steadily grew stiffer in his boxers, her feathery touches sending him into a ticklish frenzy. It was then that she did something that she'd never imagined herself doing; she paused for a moment to take a kunai from Naruto's discarded weapons' pouch and cut the boxers right off of the stunned male.

Now completely exposed, Naruto looked down at Hinata with a mixture of embarrassment and curiosity. He was surprised to see that his penis was fully erect, and Hinata was staring at it with a light blush on her cheeks. "H-Hinata, what are you do-" Naruto gasped when Hinata began to tickle him all over again, her fingers brushing against his bare inner thighs again. The higher she went up (and the closer to his balls), the more it tickled.

"HINATAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! NOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAHAH! N-NOT THEHEHEHEEHEHERE! OH, DAMMIHIHIHIT!" The restrained Jinchuriki bucked and writhed, desperately trying to move away from her maddening touches. No matter how much he tried to break them, those stubborn roots would not release him. If anything, they held him even more tightly, making any type of escape impossible. "HAHAHAHAHAHEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

Hinata picked up the feather duster and brought it up to his balls, sweeping it back and forth against them ever-so-softly. She was getting excited herself, vaguely aware of how her nipples were hardening through her thin blouse.

Naruto's laugh went up two octaves, unable to move away from the duster. "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHA! I C-CAN'T TAHAHAHAKE TH-THIS, HINATAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" Tears ran down his face, helpless as the feathers teased him. He couldn't decide if this tickled just as much or more than his feet.

Hinata reached up and delved her finger into that hidden crevice where his inner thigh joined his torso, tickling it lightly. With his legs forcibly spread, Naruto couldn't close them to lessen the effect. He tried begging her to stop between hysterical laughter, but his words were incoherent and Hinata was determined to keep her promise to him by not stopping.

Eventually, Hinata eased up on the torture, allowing Naruto to catch his breath for a few moments while she contemplated where she should tickle him next. Her normal shyness had momentarily gone out the window, and she gazed longingly at his throbbing manhood, which had begun to leak just a bit with fluids. She picked up a stiff feather, her eyes briefly locking with Naruto's as she moved towards her next target. With long, teasing strokes, she began to drag the feather up and down the entire length of his cock, smiling to herself when she heard him sputter out a protest mixed in with uncontrollable giggles. Back and forth she ran the feather down his highly sensitive member, his giggles soon turning into full-blown insane laughter.

"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" Naruto tugged at his bonds harder than ever before, his efforts remaining futile. He'd never thought that his most private area could be so ticklish, but Hinata had proven him otherwise. If anything, he was more stunned by the fact that someone so shy would be tormenting a spot such as that. "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! STOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAHAP! I HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH CAHAHAHAHAHA!" He couldn't even finish his sentence, his words drowning out within his laughter.

Hinata used the feather to draw small, teasing circles at the tip of his dripping, erect cock, completely fascinated by his reaction. The tip was even more ticklish than the rest of his member, and his laughter grew even louder than ever before. However, Hinata ceased the tickling to his crotch after about five minutes and moved around so that she was standing behind him.

Naruto nervously looked back over his shoulder, his body glistening with sweat. "H-Hinata, what are you going t-to do?" He soon got his answer when he felt the feather duster sweep across his bare buttocks, causing him to let out a surprised yelp. He tried to wiggle his ass away from the feathers, but was unable to avoid them as the indigo-haired female tickled him. It wasn't quite as bad as the cock-tickling, but was still maddening nonetheless.

Hinata concentrated on his butt for over a half hour, making sure to tease his crack and get his sit spots right below the curve of his ass. She even slipped the duster between his thighs and tormented him behind his balls for another fifteen minutes, nearly making the blond ninja lose his mind.

Naruto howled with laughter as a single feather delved into his crack and tickled his asshole, torturing that secret (and embarrassing) spot. Luckily for him, Hinata only tickled that particular spot for a few minutes before moving onto another area of his body. Though he couldn't have been too lucky, as that area happened to be his feet.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! PLEHEHEHEHEHEASE NOHOHOHOHOT MY FEHEHEHEHEHEHEET! IT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH TICKLES TOO MUCH!" He pleaded, dismayed that she was using the toothbrush to assault his sweaty soles. The soft bristles were perfect for tickling every last spot on his feet, and even better for getting under and in between his wiggling toes. Yet through his bellowing laughter, he could hear the soft sound of Hinata moaning. Through teary eyes he looked down to see Hinata staring up at his crotch as she tickled his feet. He couldn't believe that he was still so hard, despite just how much the tickling was driving him crazy. However, he noticed that Hinata's nipples were stiff and felt his cock twitch with excitement when she reached up to tease it again. And although his manhood was ridiculously ticklish, his laughter became mixed with moans of pleasure.

The minutes ticked by, gradually turning into hours. Hinata spent a good part of the time switching back and forth between Naruto's feet and crotch area, getting a combination of hysteria and arousal. Due to the teasing of his nether regions, Naruto felt ready to explode and desperately needed to come by now.

"Hinata," he moaned as she licked at his inner thighs, the paintbrush lightly tickling his tip. "I...hehehehahahaha...I need to...oh, god...hehehahaha," he giggled, having difficulty in voicing his needs.

The kunoichi seemed to understand what he was getting at and began stroke his tip with more intensity and vigor. Naruto laughed and moaned, feeling himself getting closer and closer. He jumped when her tongue licked at his inner thigh, but most of his concentration was fixated on his teased member.

"Naruto-kun," Hinata whispered, tickling his tip relentlessly as his fluids of excitement dripped out. After a few more seconds, and a brief debate with herself, she pulled the paintbrush away and replaced it with her tongue. Her fingers reached up and lightly tickled his balls, giving her a mixed response of moans and laughter.

"HAHAHAHA! OOOHH! AHAHAHA, oh damn...HEHEHAHAHAHAHA! Mmm..." Naruto closed his eyes and threw his head back, feeling himself peak as Hinata's skilled tongue finally relieved him of the building pressure. "A-AAAH!" He exploded inside of Hinata's mouth, grinning stupidly as he felt her swallow his seed. She was still tickling his balls, which felt even more sensitive now that he'd been allowed to orgasm. He'd never imagined himself getting off like that, but it had been absolutely mind-blowing.

The only downside of his release, was now his body felt even more sensitive than before, particularly his post-orgasm member. And there were still two hours left to go. He was exhausted, and felt as though he would pass out very soon, despite his efforts.

"You can do this, Naruto-kun," Hinata assured him, tickling him behind his knees. "Will this help?" She paused long enough to remove her blouse and skirt, leaving herself in a lacy, white bra with matching panties.

All at once, Naruto's eyes went wide and his mouth hung open, taking in her features. He was speechless, but that was all Hinata needed for an answer. She happily continued on with the torture, going back to every part of his body she'd tickled previously. After laughing, begging, struggling, and writhing for those two hours, the test was finally over. The roots ceased their hold on the Jinchuriki, lowering him back to the floor. Hinata moved quickly to catch Naruto as he toppled forward, but ended up falling backwards with him on top of her.

"Sorry...Hinata..." Naruto apologized in between panting. "I'm just...really...tired..." His naked body was soaked in sweat, which was pressed deliciously against Hinata's.

"Y-you did it," she congratulated him, rather flustered and now back to her usual shy demeanor. "You made it to the end." Her head was spinning, and she felt like she was going to faint. Not that she wasn't enjoying it, but he was stark naked on top of her.

"See...I told you I could do it," he chuckled with a victorious grin. "And it was because you helped me." It had nearly driven him insane, but it had been well worth it. He just wouldn't admit to the fact that he had liked it. Then again, it was pretty obvious, even to a thick-headed ninja such as himself.

Hinata smiled innocently. "Glad I was able to help." And she wouldn't mind doing it again. If anything, she hoped she could do it again in the near future.

Naruto got off of her and pulled her up, his high stamina already allowing him to quickly recover from the six-hour long torture. He was having dirty thoughts as he stared at Hinata's close-to-naked body, but the last thing they needed was to be caught doing something inappropriate in the middle of the interrogation room. 'Too late,' he thought to himself with amusement as they both dressed.

When they exited the room, they were surprised to learn that Naruto wasn't the only one who had taken part in the test. Sasuke, Sai, and Shikamaru had apparently attempted the endurance test as well, accompanied by Sakura, Ino, and Temari. Needless to say, the males were all rather embarrassed, while the girls were smiling with gleeful satisfaction. It had certainly been fun for them.

"Four of you took part in the test today," a member from the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force," Kakashi began, "but only one of you was able to complete it. Coming in last was Shikamaru, who lasted one and a half hours. Third is Sai, who lasted two and a half hours. Sasuke came in third, managing to make it to the three-hour mark. And finally, Naruto comes out on top by making it through all six hours, which has never been done before. Congratulations, Naruto. Here is your reward." He held out a coupon. "This will allow you to eat at Ichiraku's for a week free."

Sasuke, Sai, and Shikamaru gaped in disbelief. They had gone through tickling hell, only for the winner to receive a coupon for ramen!? Sure, the aspect of bragging rights would've been nice, but none of them really wanted to brag about what they'd been through. Or mention it to a single soul, for that matter. Nonetheless, the coupon was a perfect gift for Naruto, who happily ran off with Hinata for a celebratory meal. Maybe after they ate, they could go back to his place for a bit more fun. And maybe, if he was lucky, Hinata might tickle him again...
